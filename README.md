### Marketing Strategy
The site owner is not interested in joining Etsy as she feels the platform is too crowded, and there is some suggestion it has declined. [TechPenny blames Etsy's algorithms](https://techpenny.com/typical-etsy-demographics-stats/) and the amount of time customers must spend on the platform only to get frustrated and leave after they don't find what they are looking form. By contrast, [Statista.com](https://www.statista.com/statistics/409375/etsy-active-buyers/) reported an 18% increase in sales. Reuter's reports Etsy has suffered related to [SVBs collapse with resulting delays processing sellers' payments](https://www.reuters.com/markets/etsy-other-e-commerce-companies-feel-squeeze-svb-collapse-2023-03-13/), with some sellers complaining Etsy lacked transparency. Notwithstanding these reports on the Etsy platform itself, there is a clear interest by consumers in handcrafted items created by small businesses. 

#### Understanding the audience

Paper Dreams' audience is matches the Etsy Community whose audience is described as largely females between the ages of 18-35. Etsy estimates 86% of their buyers are female. Like Etsy, the site owner expects the audience to be young, female and interested in unique, original items with vibrant colour palettes. [Etsy describes the buyer's behaviour and trends](https://www.etsy.com/seller-handbook/article/marketplace-insights-emerging-etsy-buyer/811544572163) of which the following apply to Paper Dreams:

1. They want to support small businesses. They use the hashtag #StandWithSmall. The site could also make use of this hashtag. [Statusbrew](https://statusbrew.com/insights/small-business-hashtags/) lists some top trending small business hashtags.  [Top-Hashtags](https://top-hashtags.com/hashtag/smallbusiness/) offers  some useful ideas, moving away from the specific art scene to other interest areas of potential customers, such as #womanownedbusiness, #newbusiness, #supportsmallshops, #handcraftedgifts, #handmadecrafts, and  #handcrafted"add item". 

2. They want to make their homes more stylish with unique bright items. 

3. The are interested in projects they can do from home. (Relates to tutorials/learn page)

4. The are looking for unique gifts for various occasions. 

For the purpose of this marketing strategy, we want to think about our customer in narrow terms in order to be able to create useful keywords for the site and and overall marketing strategy.

2. On page optimization

    **Home page**
    - Page titles
    - Meta descriptions
    - Headers
    - Content

    If this were a genuine business, it would make sense for the artist to use her name as the domain name and then change the site title to Paper Dreams by "Artist Name".

    
    **Products page**
    - Page titles
    - Meta descriptions
    - Headers
    - Content

    **Events page**
    - Page titles
    - Meta descriptions

3. Off-page optimization

    If this  were a real site, the business should seek to engage with other artists and website owners by writing guest blogs, or by asking them to link to this site for its resources (the tutorials blog), events or by reviewing our site and art works. An obvious place to start would be papiermache.co.uk which is a platfrom for papier mache artists. By posting there regularly, you quickly become part of a community and if you post projects there, your project will be the first or one of the first visitors to the site will see. Many of these artists have their own websites and community connections and are generous with help and advice.

4. Technical optimization

    - Page loads fast
    - Mobile friendly
    - Easy to navigate

5. Content

    - Text is highly relevant to page purpose. No superflous text.
    - Non commercial content aims to retain visitors/create repeat visitors

## Website Design
### The Strategy Plane
The goals of the site are similar to that of Etsy and NotOnTheHighStreet. This site aims to offer users unique items to bring a bit of joy into their lives.  The site owner does not wish to have a profile on these sites, because they wish to display works not for sale as well as to provide tutorials. While the site will be online, and can be thought of as having a global reach, the site owner is also very much involved in the community, and wishes to have an exclusive site.

#### Site-Owner Goals
This is a website for an artist to sell their artwork under the name "Paper Dreams". The overall goals of the website are to:

1. Present the artist's work in an attractive way.
2. Give visibility to other artists who's work will be shown on the events page of the website. 
3. Inspire people to create and share their own works of art.
4. Gain insight on which products customers like.
5. Increase sales potential with online presence.
6. To track customer sales to make tax reporting easier.
7. To engage with customers and the artistic community via a tutorials page and the site's links to her Facebook page.
8. To offer exclusive opportunities to registered users, such as free tickets to exhibitions.

### Site Visitor Goals
1. To discover unique artwork that can not be found in shops.
2. To be able to see clearly what is available for sale.
3. To be able to make a purchase quickly and easily.
4. To have visible, clear information about shipping and returns polciies.
5. To make and leave reviews.
6. To be able to easily contact the shop with questions.
7. To add/delete items from a wishlist.
8. For some, to learn how to make their own artworks
9. To understand how my personal information will be used. 
 

### Emotional Factors
It is the artist's hope that her artworks will help site visitors reimagine their surroundings. The site should be easy and intutive to navigate so as not to detract from the works themselves. An attractive website will add to the value of the work as the same care as creating the art will go into the presentation of it via the website. Even if the customer is not ready to buy, it is the hope of the site owner that the customer will like the experience of the site so much that they will return repeatedly to look and browse.  

The reviews page is also meant to be something of a community page where customers can leave their thoughts about their purchases and also upload photos to show how they are displaying the product at home or in their workplace. The idea is that it will inspire prospective customers, and encourage conversation. 

### User Stories

### Contraints
The major constrainst is the timeline for completing the project. 

## The Structure Plane
### Planning
As this is an e-commerce site, the major objective is to sell artworks. The customer journey from the perspective of making a purchase is described below. The elements of the site related to exhibitions and tutorials have the objective of building advocacy for the company, enabling it to build a following and retain customer interest beyond the intitial point of sale.  

#### The Customer Journey

- **Discovery/Awareness:**  The customer is likely to hear about or find the website via word of mouth, search engines or social media. The site owner will not be buying advertising space.
    - User Action - asks a friend if they know any sites, uses keyword searches to find sites.
    - Emotion - initially curious. Happy.
    - Touch points - directly visit the site (word of mouth/recommendation), google result.
- Consideration: Looks at multiple artworks before making a decision
    - User Action - Compares several sites
    - Touchpoints - homepage if given by friend, or directly landing on product page, product detail page, or blog page after Google search.
    - Emotions - If the site works as the user expects, they would be largely indifferent about the site itself, but if it requires too many clicks or if is hard to find what they are looking at they might get annoyed and leave the site.
    - Pain points:
        - Website is boring.
        - Website is difficult to navigate
        - Customer can be overwhelmed if there are too many clicks or steps to make it to purchase point.
        - Can't find an artwork they had already viewed.
        - Site loads slowly.
    - Solutions:
        - Navigation should be clear.
        - Photos and information on product page should be informative enough that the customer does not need to open every product detail page.
        - Product page should allow category filtering and a search field.
        - The inclusion of free information, like tutorials, and ways to get involved, for example exhibitions, should add interest and build a sense of community.
        - Create wishlist so user's can easily save items they are interested in to a list.
- Purchase:
    - User actions: 
        - selects products, adds it to the bag, fills in form, enters card details, confirms payment.

        - Happy if they can call upon shipping details already entered in the past and purchase quicker. 
        - Angry if faced with a lot of error messages, forms that are unclear, a payment field that is not clear about what cards it accepts.
    - Pain points;
        - Form is so restrictive that it is hard to get through it without a lot of errors.
        - Checkout doesn't support all card types.

    - Touchpoints:
    - Customer reviews page.
    - Painpoints as mentioned above in user actions section.
    - Solutions:
        - Include shipping tracking field in custom model and trigger an email when product is marked as fulfilled.
        - Give incentives for customers to give reviews to better understand customer journey and make improvements to the website. 
        - Include links in the confirmation email to encourage to come to exhibitions or follow the tutorials.
        - Make it easy to share products
        - Post tutorials frequently and keep events page for as long as it is regularly updated. Giving customers a reason to keep returning to the site for interesting activities and learning should create advocates for the website and company.
